## Packages
**Express** : Allows you to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.

**body-parser**: It is used to handle HTTP post requests and extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body.

**cookie-parser**: It is used for parsing the cookies

**bcrypt** : It is used for hashing and comparing the passwords.

**mongoose** : It is used to connect to our MongoDB database.

**jsonwebtoken** : JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

**nodemon** : Itâ€™s my favorite and it led to automatically restarting of our node application when any changes occur in our app.
